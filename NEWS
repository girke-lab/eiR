The eiR packages introduces efficient methods for accelerating structure
similarity searches and clustering of very large compound datasets. The
acceleration is achieved by applying embedding and indexing techniques to
represent chemical compounds in a high-dimensional Euclidean space and to
employ ultra-fast pre-screening of the compound dataset using the LSH-assisted
nearest neighbor search in the embedding space. This method can drastically
reduce the search time of large databases, by a factor of 40â€“200 fold when
searching for the 100 closest compounds to a query.
